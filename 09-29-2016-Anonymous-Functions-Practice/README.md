# Anonymous Functions Practice

This program uses a function as a parameter in the function threeOperation. 

By declaring multiple global functions, threeOperation is able to run and "do" different things depending on the global function it takes as a parameter when calling it. 

In this case it can find the sum and the product, but you can write more functions so it can do even more when it's called.
