This program holds a library of books. 

Using an Object constructor makes sure you can easily add books to it, as you please. 

When you call the program with a specific book, it 'reads' (aka prints) the book title, and it's pages. 

By using a loop for printing out the pages, it doesn't matter if you only have 1 page in the array or a gazillion. It prints outs the existing pages in the book with the proper page number in front of it.
